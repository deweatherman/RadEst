# "RadEst" routines and parts

Python based optimal estimation tooling for Satellite Observations.
Hopefully we will get to the point where open source community standards guide proper scientific software development.
The tools provided in this repo make use of several available packages/environments/software ecosystems such as:

- [pyOpEst](https://github.com/maahn/pyOptimalEstimation)
- [RTTOV](https://nwp-saf.eumetsat.int/site/software/rttov/)
- [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/)
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- Others that I might forget at this time (apologies for that)
 

## Purpose of the repo

- Provide a practical example on how to setup an [Optimal Estimation tool in Python](https://github.com/maahn/pyOptimalEstimation)
together with a standard Satellite Observation Radiative Transfer code like [RTTOV](https://nwp-saf.eumetsat.int/site/software/rttov/).
- Involve interested scientists/developers from the Earth Observation / Satellite Observations / Machine Learning community in an open science tool for the benefit of the community itself


## Documentation

For now we use the markdown standard for Jupyter Notebooks and a "good" commented code as a basis to start the conversation.
