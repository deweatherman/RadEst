# "RadEst" routines and parts

Python based modules, that hopefully if put together will retrieve 
physical variables such as Near Surface Wind Speed, Sea Surface Temperature
etc. by using onboard radiometer observations (i.e. Brightness Temperatures in K)
and apriori data.

## Purpose of the repo

This is a first version of the modules and the repo is intended as a practical
way to practice version control using Git as a day-to-day way of working.


## Documentation

Coming soon.
